        <h3>Musician</h3>
        <p>
          I have been a musician for ten years. I studied at the Municipal
          Lyceum of Esperanza and currently perform in two orchestras: the
          Humboldt Orchestra and the San Carlos Norte Orchestra. This experience
          strengthened my teamwork, coordination, time management, and
          discipline — skills I also apply to my work in game development and
          production.
